## Boom Arm Clips
I tried a few clips available on Thiniverse and [this boom arm clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5029672) worked the best for fitting snug on my mic boom arm but the cable clip part was too wide on top (my mic uses a thinner USB cable). I remade the original design in fusion360 with the intention of making the gap slimmer but ended up flipping the gap so the arm holds the cable in instead and it worked really well.

The STL can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5275446)
