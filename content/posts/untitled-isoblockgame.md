## Untitled IsoBlockGame

I still don't have a name for this game yet. because original ideas in gaming have never existed 
its best described as "Dwarf Fortress Like". The graphical look I'm aiming for is old isometric sprite based 
games like Sim City 2000 and Transport Tycoon. 

Small world blocks are generated using simplex noise and can be sliced to view the world in layers.
