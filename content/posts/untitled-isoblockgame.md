## Untitled IsoBlockGame
The main project I'm working on at the moment
is a game I have been making off and on for a 
few years now. I still don't have an offical name
for this game yet, at the moment the project name
is isoblockgame.

### The Elevator Pitch
because original ideas in gaming have never
existed its best described as "Dwarf Fortress
Like" in gameplay but much less complex. 
The graphical style I'm aiming for is old 
isometric sprite based games like Sim City 
2000 and Transport Tycoon. 

### The World
A chunk of world is generated from cube sprites
using simplex noise. This chuck of world can be 
sliced to view as layers. Moving up and down the
layers enables the player to see inside 
mountains and underground. 

### The Player
People, Monsters and Animals move around the 
world using AI they can not be controlled 
directly by the player only influenced.
