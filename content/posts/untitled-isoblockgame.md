## Untitled IsoBlockGame

I still don't have a name for this game yet,
at the moment the project name is isoblockgame.

because original ideas in gaming have never
existed its best described as "Dwarf Fortress
Like" in gameplay but much less complex. 
The graphical look I'm aiming for is old 
isometric sprite based games like Sim City 
2000 and Transport Tycoon. 

Small world chunks of cubes are generated 
using simplex noise and can be sliced to view 
the world as layers. Moving up and down the 
layers enables the player to see inside 
mountains and underground.
