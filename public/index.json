The graphical style I\u0026rsquo;m aiming for is old isometric sprite based games like Sim City 2000 and Transport Tycoon.\nThe World A chunk of world is generated from cube sprites using simplex noise. This chuck of world can be sliced to view as layers. Moving up and down the layers enables the player to see inside mountains and underground.\nThe Player People, Monsters and Animals move around the world using AI they can not be controlled directly by the player only influenced.\n","permalink":"https://prosthetichead.dev/posts/untitled-isoblockgame/","summary":"Untitled IsoBlockGame The main project I\u0026rsquo;m working on at the moment is a game I have been making off and on for a few years now.

At the moment we are going by 1 update tick == 1 game world hour. Update ticks can be set to be any fraction of real world seconds so .5 real world seconds could equal 1 game hour for example, this should result in being able to set the games speed.\nGrass growing right now is done by looking for blocks with grass as the floor checking if a dirt floor block is nearby and if it is doing a dice roll, the dice roll chooses if a grow happens and the direction it will grow in.\nTrees are my first World Entity class.
