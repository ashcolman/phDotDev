      <description>Untitled IsoBlockGame I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a name for this game yet, at the moment the project name is isoblockgame.
because original ideas in gaming have never existed its best described as &amp;ldquo;Dwarf Fortress Like&amp;rdquo; in gameplay but much less complex. The graphical look I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for is old isometric sprite based games like Sim City 2000 and Transport Tycoon.
Small world chunks of cubes are generated using simplex noise and can be sliced to view the world as layers.</description>

      <description>Tonight I was able to get block floors and trees updating on update ticks. At the moment we are going by 1 update tick == 1 game world hour. Update ticks can be set to be any fraction of real world seconds so .5 real world seconds could equal 1 game hour for example, this should result in being able to set the games speed.
Grass growing right now is done by looking for blocks with grass as the floor checking if a dirt floor block is nearby and if it is doing a dice roll, the dice roll chooses if a grow happens and the direction it will grow in.</description>
